				orange v1.11

This is a script for sending messages to Orange phones (available in the UK).
It works by POSTing the message to a form on the Orange web site.
Before using the script you must register to get a username and password.

To install this script, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make install

The script is fully documented using pod. Once installed you should get
a man page. It also supports two informational switches:

	-help	display a short help message
	-doc	format the pod documentation to the tty

The script requires the libwww-perl5 distribution; you can get the
latest version from CPAN at:

	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/LWP/

It also uses Andy Wardley's App::Config module, and
Brad Appleton's Pod::Usage. Both modules are available from CPAN.

I'd be happy to hear of any suggestions for improving this script.
